# MKron

>A cron daemon written by **M**atthew **K**unjummen

MKron is written in Go and designed to be simple to write and (roughly)
POSIX compatible.

For details on how it runs and how to use it, check OUTLINE.md

**WARNING!**

This program was made for my own amusement and out of a desire to learn a new
language (Go). Things may be (read: are) incomplete and unpolished.

## Dependencies

- Go (duh)
- Some sh compatible shell

That should be it!

## Build Instructions

	go get github.com/SoWhich/mkron
	go install github.com/SoWhich/mkron

## Contributors

- [Joe Lafreniere](http://github.com/lafrenierejm) for helping with clarity
and the logic of the code (among other things)
